This is the main project I worked on in ECS 170 (Introduction to Artificial Intelligence). In this class, I learned how to design and implement intelligent computer systems. I also learned knowledge representation and organization, memory and inference, and natural language processing. In this project, I worked with David, Darren, Justin, Cory, Nathan, Ziyi, Taniqsha, and Chuyuan, all of whom are undergraduate college students at UC Davis. We developed a data-driven predictive autoscaling framework using an LSTM network to model CPU and memory utilization from Google Borg traces. Our goal for the project was to forecast short-term resource usage and show how proactive scaling can improve system stability while reducing costs.
